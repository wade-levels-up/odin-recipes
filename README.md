Demonstrate Creating A Basic HTML website without CSS Styling

This website is project I'm creating as part of following through
The Odin Project, by the end of this I will have demonstrated my
ability to create a basic HTML website with links to separate pages,
implementation of the correct HTML semantics and a Git workflow inclusive
of staging, commits and pushes to Github.
