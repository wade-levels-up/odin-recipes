    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I'm showing you how to make gluten-free, grain-free, low-carb, high-protein donuts 
        that are healthy enough to eat for breakfast, without all the guilt and shame. 
        You might think "that sounds great, but they must taste terrible like all 'healthy' 
        donuts," but that's the thing--they don't! They taste really good, especially if they're 
        covered in chocolate. These donuts may be topped with melted dark chocolate and garnished 
        with toasted coconut, chopped almonds, or dark chocolate chips if desired.
    </p>
    <p>
        These gluten-free, grain-free, low-carb, high-protein donutsmight not be quite as sweet 
        and decadent as regular donuts. But to me at least, they're significantly more enjoyable 
        than any of those supposedly healthy breakfast bars.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Vegetable Oil Cooking Spray</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Large Egg:</strong> x2</li>
        <li><strong>Vegetable Oil:</strong> 2 tablespoons</li>
        <li><strong>Maple Syrup:</strong> 3 tablespoons</li>
        <li><strong>Almond flour:</strong> 1 1/4 cups (finely ground)</li>
        <li><strong>Baking powder:</strong> 1 1/2 teaspoons</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong> 1/2 a teaspoon</li>
        <li><strong>Cocoa powder</strong> 2 tablespoons</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Generously spray or brush a nonstick donut pan with cooking spray; set aside until needed.</li>
        <li>Place eggs, vegetable oil, and maple syrup into a mixing bowl and whisk thoroughly until the mixture is emulsified, light, and a little bit foamy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add almond flour, baking powder, salt, and cocoa powder; mix everything together thoroughly with a spatula until all the almond flour is incorporated and you've achieved a very thick batter.</li>
        <li>Transfer batter into a pastry bag, or a plastic zip-top bag with one of the corners cut off. Pipe the batter evenly into the prepared donut pan.</li>
        <li>Dip a finger in water and smooth the tops of the batter to even out. Tap the pan on a work surface a few times to settle the batter even more.</li>
        <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until a wooden skewer inserted into a donut comes out clean, 9 to 10 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes before inverting onto a wire cooling rack. Cool completely before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <h5>Chef's Notes:</h5>
    <p>The donut pan can also be greased with soft butter.</p>
    <p>You can use any fat of your choice instead of vegetable oil--butter, coconut oil, or extra-virgin olive oil, to name a few. You can use 1/4 teaspoon fine salt instead of kosher salt. Make sure to use high-quality Dutch-process cocoa powder. I used Bob's Red Mill(R) almond flour.</p>
    <p>You can add a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the batter if you like.</p>
